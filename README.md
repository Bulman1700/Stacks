My implementation of a generic stack container using linked lists! 

The 'linkedlist' package includes 'Node.java' and 'LinkedList.java' and are needed for the linked list implementation of stacks.

The 'stacks' package contains the abstract Stack class, as well as the LinkedListStack representation. It also contains a FancilyPrintable interface used for when you want to print the stacks in an extra fancy way.

Stacks perform the following operations:
    
    push();
    pop(data);
    peek();
    isFull();
    isEmpty();
    destroyStack();
    print();

The 'TestStack.java' file is a simple program that prints a main menu to the screen and allows the user to push and pop to and from the stack to their heart's content.
